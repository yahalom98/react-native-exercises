# Quick Start Guide - Week 3

## How to Use This Lesson

### Option 1: Use Week3 App Directly

1. Navigate to the week3 folder:
   ```bash
   cd week3
   ```

2. Copy dependencies (if needed):
   The week3 folder uses the same dependencies as the parent project. Make sure you have installed dependencies in the parent `react-native-expo-examples-main` folder.

3. Modify the parent App.js to import week3/App.js, or run:
   ```bash
   # From the react-native-expo-examples-main folder
   npx expo start
   ```

### Option 2: Integrate with Existing Project

1. Copy the examples and exercises folders to your project
2. Import the components you need in your App.js
3. Use the examples as reference
