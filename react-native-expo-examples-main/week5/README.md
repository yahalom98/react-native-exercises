# Week 5 – React Native Basics (Expo + Expo Router)

This is a **reset-project style** example for your Week 5 React Native lesson.

It focuses on:

- Styling with `StyleSheet` and flexbox
- Reusable components (buttons, inputs, cards, containers)
- File-based routing with Expo Router
- Stack navigation, animations, and a modal screen
- API calls with `axios`
- Search, pull-to-refresh, and list rendering
- Simple animations using the React Native `Animated` API

> This is **not** a full Expo project.  
> Drop the `week5` folder into an existing Expo Router workspace, or copy pieces into your training repo.
