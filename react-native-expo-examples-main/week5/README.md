# Week 5 – React Native Basics (Expo + Expo Router)

This folder is a reset-project style example for Week 5.

Focus:
- Styling with StyleSheet and flexbox
- Reusable components
- Pages (screens) with Expo Router
- Stack navigation + transitions
- API calls with axios
- Params between screens

This is not a full Expo project. Drop this week5 folder into your existing Expo / Expo Router training repo.
